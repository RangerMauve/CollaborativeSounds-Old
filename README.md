Project Name: Collaborative Sounds

Project URL: http://collsounds-nullset.rhcloud.com/

Have you ever wanted to get together with either friends or total strangers and work together to make something that sounds nice? Well with the Web Audio API and this project you'll be able to! Drag different "nodes" and generate, modify, and time sounds! This will be coded with a Node.js backend using Socket.IO for realtime updates, and probably some SVG for the graphics on the front end.

Note: Please use Google Chrome as most browsers do not support the Web Audio API enough.
